    <div class="blog-lead"><p><a href="http://ohmage.org">OhMage</a> may be the premiere end-to-end tool for researcher-configurable mobile data collection. While the ostensible target audience is healthcare researchers, the toolkit is general enough to be used in any sort of mobile health study. There are a number of papers and projects that have taken advantage of this system.</p>

<p>The truly interesting work is being done by <a style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;" href="http://openmhealth.org/about/">Open mHealth</a>, which have written data schemas and APIs targeting both general and clinical mobile data collection (http://www.openmhealth.org/developers/schemas/). The backend data framework is made client agnostic using the abstraction of Data Storage Units (https://github.com/openmhealth/developer/wiki/DSU-Overview) [Note: These are somewhat analogous to resources in the RESTful sense with a highly constrained HTTP request/response API specification. I think the term is used to distinguish this API specification from the ’third-party provider API specifications under a separate heading on the website such as FitBit, etc.]. Complimentary to the Data Storage Units are Data Processing Units. This is quite innovative in this space. The idea is to permit data flow pipelines, which may be chained to operate on incoming data in a stateless manner. In essence, this enables a ‘functional’ approach to data processing, which could take advantage of parallel processing architectures and permit distributed collection and analysis infrastructure for larger-scale survey efforts. The information on Data Visualization Units is a bit more sketchy, but one could imagine a service like Tableau, which preprocesses data based on whether it is quantitative, qualitative, geospatial, etc., and permit more automated and collaborative exploratory data analysis for both participants and researchers through a web interface.</p>
