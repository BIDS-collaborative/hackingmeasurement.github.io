## Summary

Tony Fountain has been instrumental in applying the OSDT to environmental
measurement. It was developed initially by U.S. government organizations (such
as NASA) to integrate real-time streams of data from planes, and other
difficult-to-synchronize data sources. Tony has played mostly a managerial role
in this, and has often had to be the one writing grants to get domain scientists
to use the code he's promoting.

Tony is in the process of winding down his research unit, and has many a story
to tell -- both of his adventures installing sensor networks in exotic (and
not-so-exotic) locales and also his experiences finding non-traditional jobs for
himself and others to support this work.

Working with Tony would be an excellent opportunity to do ethnography and
investigate career options and implications in addition to any input he might
provide on using OSDT and other approaches to environmental sensing.

Tony is very open to individuals extending, modifying, or simply learning
lessons from the OSDT. 

Notes are currently in Dav's ISCS notebook and also in his Hacking Measurement
Evernote notebook.
