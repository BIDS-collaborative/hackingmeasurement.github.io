## Brief summary

Civil Maps is a start-up at the UC Berkeley Skydeck. Dav met with Fabian, and
they discussed a potential project to open-source the Civil Maps browser-based
point-cloud + feature visualization stack. This (combined with a suitable
data-set and visualization challenge) is a likely project for the Fall course.
