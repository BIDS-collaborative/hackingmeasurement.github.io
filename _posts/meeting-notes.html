<p><br>
Major threads:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Who can you empower?</li>
	<li>Hard to coordinate between organizations â€“ they don't want to expose their faults</li>
	<li>Can citizen science be a way around this?</li>
	<li>Can we enable folks like Zach's collaborators, Yoga teachers, etc.?</li>
</ul>

<p>Can we get funding from the Indian government - also perhaps Chile.</p>

<p>Can link to existing stuff that Zach's collaborator wrote up.</p>

<p>Also an interest in stuff with sensors. This would be a tie-in with Mezuri.</p>
