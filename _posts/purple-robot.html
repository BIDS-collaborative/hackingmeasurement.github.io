    <h2>Purple Robot</h2>
    
    <div class="blog-lead"><p>There is some impressive technological firepower behind <a href="http://tech.cbits.northwestern.edu/">NorthWestern</a>’s <a href="http://tech.cbits.northwestern.edu/purple-robot/">Purple Robot</a> and allied framework. The team has built something of a goliath in terms of functionality and features. The most interesting feature here is that the system includes a built-in client-side web server. This creates the opportunity for fluent remote scripting and configuration of survey/experiment parameters. If the client-side survey mechanism is kept general enough, one could use such a system to create dynamic, reactive survey instruments. The question of scale becomes an important one here, and I am less convinced that the data management aspects of this system are as sophisticated as the client-side engineering. Additionally, I’m not sure about how easy it is for a researcher to design experiments using the provided toolkit. However, in terms of exercising the features of Android as a rapidly configurable platform for mobile sensing and ubiquitous computing, this is a very exciting project.</p>
