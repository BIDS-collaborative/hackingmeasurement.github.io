## Agenda

We will be meeting again with one of the main developers on the [Open Data Kit
(ODK) project](http://opendatakit.org) (Waylon Brunette). In brief, ODK is
focused on using mobile phones to assess field experiments, mostly in economic
development.  Initially, this was focused on doing surveys on phones and
tablets, expanding to make sensor information from the phone and also bluetooth
connected sensors available. I see it as one of the most successful open
platforms for mobile survey / sensor data collection.

We'll be talking specifically about the sensor side of things, which is far less
developed than the survey aspect. Falk and I are currently focused on a good
platform for connecting sensors for folks with a "maker" level of competence
(which might be a certain kind of data scientist).
