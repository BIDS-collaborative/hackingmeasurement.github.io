    <h2>Funf</h2>
    
    <div class="blog-lead"><p><a href="http://www.funf.org/">Funf</a> is a project out of MIT, which despite not being particularly easy for a researcher to use out of the box (funfinabox notwithstanding), is actually the closest of any current project to achieving a Unix-like component architecture for Android. It’s core speciality is to abstract sensor-based data collection. As such, I’ve found it simple to integrate into my own survey instruments and it has performed beautifully without me needing to write a large amount of adapter code. This approach for the client-side architecture, combined with the RESTful approach of OhMage may be most suitable for large-scale platform engineering.</p>
