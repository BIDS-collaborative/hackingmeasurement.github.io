## In attendance

 - Waylon Brunette (UW, ODK)
 - Falk Schuetzenmeister (Ecoengine, BIDS)
 - Guillaume Kroll (CEGA / BITSS)
 - Javier Rosa (TIER / Mezuri)
 - Matt Podolsky (TIER / Mezuri)
 - Sidney Alexander Feygin (EECS)
 - Temina Madon (CEGA)

 - Mia Bruch (Matrix)

## Agree on a plan for the seminar

 - Several have proposed (and Mia concurs) that smaller meetings this semester
   to bang out details for a great seminar in fall is great
 - Summer plans?
 - Quick review of what’s in google drive, website, etc.
 - Waylon: (agrees with Temina) in person intro (Dav: plus community building) -
   use recorded modules for details
    - Seminar could provide overview, with reference materials for later use
    - Project-based learning in teams could be valuable (pedagogically)
    - Harness junior developers to work on specific features?
 - The class may equip people to decide if they are excited / interested in
   contributing
 - TODO: Send outline documents to Waylon
 - TODO: Reach out for tentative project sources – ODK mailing list, mobsci,
   data on the mind, Mezuri
 - TODO: Collect materials – work with David Culler?

## Check in with Waylon with a specific focus on ODK

 - What should we target for a fall seminar?
 - Are there materials / short tutorials we should be running now (e.g., in Matrix or D-Lab)?
 - TODO: We should get existing materials for training on ODK. Biggest training is Google Earth Outreach Team (also survey CTO, nefundi)
 - At UW, stopped offering training because “it doesn’t get anybody a PhD.”
 - Magda Baladinski is now Waylon’s co-advisor
 - New directions in ODK(ish):
    - UCSD - data collection w/ SMS + data cleaning & viz
    - Podolsky - energy space (not very Mezuri specific)
    - Berkeley - Airtime transfers (as currency)

## Update on what folks in the group are doing

 - E.g., Falk and Dav have been working with undergrads on sensors and public
   APIs
    - Data Science Collaborative (Dav): Students are working on random problems,
      like optimizing university procurement systems or (potentially) solving
      problems with NGOs/health agencies. Aim should be to advance quality of
      the research done by seminar participants, once they leave the seminar.
 - There is a lot of interest in looking at the software development process and
   connecting this with what’s going on in a physical space (happening more at
   UW also, with Bill Howe & Dan Halperin)
 - Ari Meir (previous PhD) instrumented tracking of google development
 - Healthcare overseas ends up being difficult with resource-limited
   organizations (research adds an overhead, takes away from direct care). Dav
   thinks this could be a good argument to develop these low-cost technologies
   in the developing world, where this is less of a problem.
