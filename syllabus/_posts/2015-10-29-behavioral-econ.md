## Background information

### What can Xlab do for you?

The Xlab is used to conduct research with human participants.  We welcome UC
Berkeley researchers of all persuasions to use our facilities and services.

- We can support in-lab studies with up to 36 computers, online studies, and
  can provide laptops for research outside the lab
- We have over 1000 people in our pool and it is expanding all the time
- We offer small research grants
- We can help manage and pay your participants
- We can provide consultation and guidance on IRB protocols
- We have several popular software packages available for researchers

### Irrational Labs

How do we take academic insights on human behavior and bring it into the
product development world?   She'll review what behavioral economics is, walk
through specific examples from her work with companies and go over their step
by step process Irrational Labs uses to tackle big problems.

Irrational labs is a non profit that uses behavioral economics to design
interventions that make people happier, healthier and wealthier.  Kristen also
started Social Observatory in SF, a group that does  field experiments around
social design and connection -- ask her about it at the end.
