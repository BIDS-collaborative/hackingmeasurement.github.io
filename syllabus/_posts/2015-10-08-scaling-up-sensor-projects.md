title: Context-aware apps and Scaling Up
author: Dav Clark
presenters: TRNQL, Javier Rosa, Malcolm Knapp
layout: class

## Agenda

- *First hour*: Presentation by  Nazmul Idris (ex-Googler, Android Team) now
  founder of [TRNQL](http://trnql.com/about-us/) on the growing importance of
  creating "contextually aware" mobile applications. Naz and team will stay for
  the full session and answer any questions that you might have.
- *Second hour*: Javier and Malcolm talk about lessons learned in scaling a
  project up and being ready to work with a contractor when warranted

## Background information

We have discussed how to build sensor prototypes and gather data from them. In
this class Naz will explain how fast & easy it can be for iOS and Android
Developers (and those aspiring to be) to integrate sensor data, data from
storage on your smartphone, and a multitude of webservices into mobile
applications to make them smarter and "contextually aware".

Javier will discuss scaling up projects as part of his research and Malcolm
will discuss how to effectively communicate and work with an external
contractor.

## Reading / Tech

 - Have a look at Have a look at [TRNQL](http://www.trnql.com) for more
   information on building contextually aware apps. You will read more about
   how to add user-activity recognition, location, and environmental data into
   any iOS and Android application using the TRNQL SDK.  Naz will also explain
   how you can join the TRNQL ["code
   competition"](http://trnql.devpost.com/) to create cool contextual apps.

## Notes

### TRNQL

### Malcolm / Consulting

**Design**: Problem definition is key and not usually well thought out.

What's the behavior?

- Signal
- Buttons
- Interfaces

E.g. A simple button

- What's its size? How does that impact where it can go?
- How much does it cost?
- How does it change the enclosure

Freezing the design

- Control Feature Creep
- How to scope accurately
- Consultant guide

What type of consultant

- A product can be divided into several key components
- Shippign
- Look and feel
- Electronics
- Program

Solution Advice

- A continuum from off-the-shelf to custom
- OTS
- Modified (usually for packaging)
- Custom

**Research Projects**: Tend to minimize aesthetics and focus on function

Searching for consultants

- Resume search
- Recomendations are better
- Be careful about experience, especially for projects in emerging regions

Be careful of contract types

- Fixed bid
- Fixed big + time and Materials
- Time and Materials

Negotiation

- Rates can be negotiated using the contract types as well an Engineer
- may be willing to do fixed bid work that has a well defined scope over 
- time and materials work that has a bit more overhead.

Client

- Give a W9 form to your consultant to register with the IRS what you are paying them
- >$600 implies an IRS 1099 form
- University handles W9s and 1099s
