## Background information
We have discussed how to build sensor prototypes and gather data from them. In this class we will discuss how sensor prototypes can be developed and deployed. Javier will discuss scaling up projects as part of his research and Malcolm will discuss how to effectively communicate and work with an external contractor.


## Reading / Tech


## Tentative plan
 - Case studies (led by Javier) on the Nieura FlexBox Project and Berkeley Improved Design Cookstoves in Ethiopia.
 - Malcolm Knapp is a local contractor who work on designing and building small scale prototype deployments.
