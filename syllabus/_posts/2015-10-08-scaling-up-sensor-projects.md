## Agenda

- *First hour*: Presentation by  Nazmul Idris (ex-Googler, Android Team) now
  founder of [TRNQL](http://trnql.com/about-us/) on the growing importance of
  creating "contextually aware" mobile applications. Naz and team will stay for
  the full session and answer any questions that you might have.
- *Second hour*: Javier and Malcolm talk about lessons learned in scaling a
  project up and being ready to work with a contractor when warranted

## Background information

We have discussed how to build sensor prototypes and gather data from them. In
this class Naz will explain how fast & easy it can be for iOS and Android
Developers (and those aspiring to be) to integrate sensor data, data from
storage on your smartphone, and a multitude of webservices into mobile
applications to make them smarter and "contextually aware".

Javier will discuss scaling up projects as part of his research and Malcolm
will discuss how to effectively communicate and work with an external
contractor.

## Reading / Tech

 - Have a look at Have a look at [TRNQL](http://www.trnql.com) for more
   information on building contextually aware apps. You will read more about
   how to add user-activity recognition, location, and environmental data into
   any iOS and Android application using the TRNQL SDK.  Naz will also explain
   how you can get join the TRNQL ["code
   competition"](http://trnql.devpost.com/) to create cool contextual apps.
