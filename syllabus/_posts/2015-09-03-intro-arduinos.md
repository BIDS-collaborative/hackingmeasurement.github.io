## Announcements

Upcoming events at [ManyLabs]():

 - Plant boxes for 2nd graders in SOMA
 - Nerds for Nature Hackathon
 - Stay tuned for details!

## Kick-starting team formation

We'll circulate through the room, and start assigning folks to teams. We'll
have facilitators organizing the projects throughout the room.

Dav:

 - BIDS Guests
 - Ecostations Data Access Monitor (EDAM)
 - HOLOS / EcoEngine (preview, but no specific project yet)
 - ODK contributions
 - Clinton Global Health Access (preview, specific projects en route)
 - Primary education tutoring

Temina:

 - BITSS open data audit
 - CEGA impact

Anthony:

 - Aurorasaurus for protest observation
 - Berkeley seismology visualizations
 - ManyLabs air quality sensors
 - (John Naulty if in the room) NeurotechX (preview, pending specific project)

## Arduinos as a basic platform


### Reading / Tech

You are highly encouraged to buy your own Arduino and related electronics!
However, we will provide teams of 2-4 with sufficient materials to complete all
projects. A shopping list will be provided.

Please read up on arduinos on the internet. Keep track of interesting URLs you
find. Good places to start are adafruit and sparkfun (they will also try to
sell you things).

### Tentative plan

 - Intro to sensor-based projects
    - GPS monitoring of water collection habits
    - Temperature monitoring of cookstoves
    - Combined sensor and actuation to implement a demand response system
    - Air quality (cf. Greg Neimeyer, Peter Sand, Matt Gee)
 - What's a microcontroller?
    - Why Arduinos
    - What else might you use?
 - What sensors are available
    - Trip sensors
    - Switches
    - Transducers (light, sound, pressure)
    - Open Energy Monitor (an open source power monitoring project)
    - Flexbox project 
    - Clamp sensors to measure current
 - Interfacing the Arduino with a sensor (using Arduino C)
 - Getting data from an Arduino to a computer with SD cards
