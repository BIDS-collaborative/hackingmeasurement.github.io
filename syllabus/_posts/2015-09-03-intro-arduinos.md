## Arduinos as a basic platform


## Reading / Tech

You are highly encouraged to buy your own Arduino and related electronics!
However, we will provide teams of 2-4 with sufficient materials to complete all
projects. A shopping list will be provided.

Please read up on arduinos on the internet. Keep track of interesting URLs you
find. Good places to start are adafruit and sparkfun (they will also try to
sell you things).

## Tentative plan

 - Intro to sensor-based projects
    - GPS
    - Temperature
    - Flexbox
    - Air quality (cf. Greg Neimeyer, Peter Sand, Matt Gee)
 - What's a microcontroller?
    - Why Arduinos
    - What else might you use?
 - What sensors are available
    - Trip sensors
    - Switches
    - Transducers
    - Open energy monitor
    - Flexbox project
 - Interfacing the Arduino with a sensor (using Arduino C)
 - Getting data from an Arduino to a computer with SD cards
