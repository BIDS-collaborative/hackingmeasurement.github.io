## Background information


## Reading / Tech
Please review Arduino code examples [here](https://github.com/BIDS-collaborative/hackingmeasurementexamples).

## Tentative plan

> __First 30 minutes__
 
- Quick team huddles, figure out where you're at.
- Getting going on GitHub:
  - Give overview of github repo creation (using EKG as example)
    - If you have an invite, accept it here: https://github.com/BIDS-collaborative
  - Create a Gitter chat room based on repo, then add github integration for your repo
  - Overview of issue creation
  - Using a GUI to synchronize files: https://desktop.github.com/ (or SourceTree)
  
> __Interlude__

- Report in from teams with interesting progress to share (maybe just EKG).

> __Wrapping up Arduinos__

- Demo of multi-sensor data logger
  - Hardware
  - Software
- Looking forward to data analysis
  - The perpetual problem of time
  
> __Team huddles__
