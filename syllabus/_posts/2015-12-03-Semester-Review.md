## Reading / Tech

Please review our very own [project pages](/projects.html)!

## Tentative plan

First, Catherine Burton from Urthecast will give us a brief overview of earth
observation satellites, remote sensing image processing, machine learning
algorithms, APIs and the advent of big data analytics and unstructured data.

Then, we'll have a lively review of the semester. If a team can't make it for
the final presentations, this is an alternative date.
