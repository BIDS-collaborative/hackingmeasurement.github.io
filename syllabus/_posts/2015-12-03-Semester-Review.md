## Announcement

Check out these [presentations from DIL
postdocs](http://dil.berkeley.edu/event/development-engineering-lessons-from-the-dil-postdocs/)
for more inspiration at 4pm after class!

## Reading / Tech

Please review our very own [project pages](/projects.html)!

## Tentative plan

First, Catherine Burton from Urthecast will give us a brief overview of earth
observation satellites, remote sensing image processing, machine learning
algorithms, APIs and the advent of big data analytics and unstructured data.

**Then we'll have class review!**

Then, we'll have a lively review of the semester. If a team can't make it for
the final presentations, this is an alternative date. Teams on deck so far:

- EDAM
- CEGA-trace
- The Carpool Project
