## Background information

The Berkeley Telemonitoring Project aims at designing an open-source platform
for the Android operating system that facilitates privacy-preserving remote
monitoring, particularly for medical use. The platform is being designed based
on lessons learned during a pilot study that we carried in collaboration with
the Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation in Chicago where we remotely
monitored 15 patients with heart failure.

As part of the platform design, we have implemented an event-based Bluetooth
stackâ€“that supports both 3.0 and 4.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy). We have also
started implementing the IEEE 11073 (Personal Health Device, or PHD) standards
on top of our Bluetooth stack, so that devices adhering to this standard can be
used in a plug-and-play fashion. Currently, we have implemented the Blood
Pressure Monitor and the Thermometer specializations of the IEEE PHD standards.
In this project we will expand the support to more specializations (the list of
specializations includes Pulse Oximeters, Weighing Scales, Glucose Meter,
Cardiovascular Fitness and Activity Monitors, and more). This project involves
Java and Android development.
