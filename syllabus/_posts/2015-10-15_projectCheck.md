## Background information

The EDAM team is developing a tool to analyze and compare biodiversity on 
islands. Biodiversity completion can then be used to promote collaboration
among researchers.

The Carpool project is collecting data via the moves app and working towards
detection of possible carpools.

Dav will lead us through a survey on Kobo, and explain some of the features
that might be relevant in different survey contexts. If there's time, he'll
also talk about a recent survey project he did.

## Announcements / Check-ins

- [Nerds for Nature
  summit](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/nerds-for-nature-summit-tickets-18110605308)
  this weekend!
- What's going on with data loggers? Have you logged data? Where is it?
- Can *everyone else* do a check in next week?
- Go to Google maps history

## EDAM

#### What is an Island?

- An environment that's totally different than the surrounding
- There are some issues in getting complete data

#### Multi-model inference shows that completeness is limited by:
    
- Distance to researchers 
- Locally available research funding
- Participation in data-sharing 

#### Goal

- Compares data and stimulates data sharing


#### Problems

- Identify factors that define biodiversity completeness
- Estimate 100% completeness
- Acquire data (open and locked)
- Promote research collaboration and open data

#### Tentative plan

- Discuss project proposal
  - Automate data processing algo for compile species list
  - Estimate the completeness of the list
  - Calculate similarity of the lists
  - Create web-accessibility visualizations

- Island bio-geography
  - Doing Side by Side Comparisons of existing Data from:
  - Moorea, French Polynesia
  - Friday Harbor, Washington, USA
  - Kaua'i, Hawai'i, USA
  - Galapagos Islands, Ecuador

#### Things To Keep in Mind
- Find open data, dark data, missing data
- Social before algo: more social problem than tech
- Define scope and start small
  - Start with birds as they are will documented



### Carpool Project

- Collecting data (our greatest challenge)
- Anonymizing, objectifying, and parsing data (to address this challenge)
- Creating data objects, links and constraints (for analysis and conclusions)
- Visualizing results (using templates)
- 8 people on the team
- Using Moves have collected data since Sept 1st
- Don't need to annotate (will result in lat long) but also can add info (Doe Library)

#### Hypothesis: People who share a location share common routes

#### Challenges
1. Receives the Moves data our users collect and report
2. fully preserves their privacy and their ownership of the data
3. enables us to prove our hypothesis

#### Data Collection
- Dates
- Locations
- Trips
- Users
###### Constraints
- Proximity
  - Distance
  - Time 
Using these as base for building the data model

###### Data Model
- Mobility
- Dates
- Location
- Trips
Very focused on privacy

#### Data Viz
- Using Templates to help illustrate data collection and conclusions
- Leaning on graphs highly, they will be critical in explaining the information that is collected

#### QA
- Project is focused on go to market strategy
  - Focused on constraining to specific groups / locations (employees of Berkeley)
  - Potentially identifying based on directions (such as to SF and back from SF)
  - Different events (carpool for church)

- Potential Carpool groups
  - School
  - Location based

- Can you collect data on things like casual carpool?
  - Trying, going to be doing surveys

#### Goals from drivers perspective
- Drive reveals location
- Never goes too far out of their way
- Voluntary, no asking for money

#### Need people for Moves Data
- Need 30 locations and  ~10 people per location
- Get to be a location leader ;)

### rcSensing

Team will place sensors by Berkeley trains to attempt to discriminate between freight and passenger trains.

## Surveys

- A review of approaches to surveys
- Collective look at Dav's Kobo survey
- Let's design our own!

## If there's time

- Neat Stuff Dav has done with a Japanese tutoring company
