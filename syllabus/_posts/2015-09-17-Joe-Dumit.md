## Agenda

- Updates:
  - Team formation is progressing. Are you on a team yet?
  - Report back from ManyLabs

- *First hour*: presentation from [Joe Dumit](http://dumit.net/), director of
  the new UC Davis Institute for [Social
  Science](http://socialscience.ucdavis.edu/).
- *Second hour*: We will complete a design for an autonomous Arduino backpack
  monitoring station!

## Background information

Joe Dumit is an Anthropologist at UC Davis. He'll be talking about the use of
games and other technologies, maybe also dance.

## Reading / Tech

These aren't required, but are interesting links from Joe:

- [Becoming a captive to machine interaction (specifically, video
  poker)](http://anthronow.com/print/gambled-away-video-poker-and-self-suspension)
- Creative human–machine interaction
    - [Blendie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DDkwdPaYmk&hd=1)
    - [Omo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiG49OPq0qY&hd=1)
- [blending virtual and real
  spaces](https://www.fxpal.com/publications/blending-digital-and-physical-spaces-for-ubiquitous-community-participation.pdf)

## Tentative plan

Joe will problematize naive data collection, including topics like:

- "Frack the Game" - a game designed as a form of social science thinking
- Clinical trial design, where controlling the questions is the game
- "Plastic" neuroscience - thinking of your data as a challenge to our "fuzzy"
  knowledge about people
- Fascia research in the biomedical and experiential realms
