## Announcements

Reminder, event at [ManyLabs](https://www.manylabs.org/):

 - Work party *today*, September 10 from 4-6 PM [at
   ManyLabs](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Manylabs/@37.777164,-122.407709,17z/data=!4m3!3m2!1s0x80858082235da2e7:0xb30be4b717ffde73!4b1).
   We will be building plant boxes for 2nd graders that will be rolled from the
   exhibit space to outside.

## Advanced topics with Arduinos

Sometimes you want a more sophisticated setup.

## Tentative plan

We'll see how far we get, and move what's left to a later class:

 - Interfacing the Arduino with a sensor (using Arduino C)
 - Getting data from an Arduino to a computer with SD cards
 - Bridging to Arduinos with Bluetooth and serial
 - Establishing and maintaining reliable connections
 - Micro-databases and communications protocols
 - Networking peripherals
 - Basic data management
 - Advanced sensors
