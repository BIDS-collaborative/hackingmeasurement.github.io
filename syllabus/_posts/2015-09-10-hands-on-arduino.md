## Announcements

Reminder, event at [ManyLabs](https://www.manylabs.org/):

 - Work party *today*, September 10 from 4-6 PM [at
   ManyLabs](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Manylabs/@37.777164,-122.407709,17z/data=!4m3!3m2!1s0x80858082235da2e7:0xb30be4b717ffde73!4b1).
   We will be building plant boxes for 2nd graders that will be rolled from the
   exhibit space to outside.

## Review of expectations / updated syllabus

I've added greater clarity around grading on [the syllabus
page](syllabus.html). We'll review this briefly at the beginning of class. In
particular, be sure that I have your GitHub ID [using this
issue](https://github.com/BIDS-collaborative/hackingmeasurement.github.io/issues/33),
and that you've joined the Gitter chat room (linked at the footer of every page
on the site).

## Hands-on with Arduinos

We've had a conceptual introdution, but this week, we'll start programming and
getting data. A limited number of kits will be available, and priority will be
given to individuals who are formally enrolled in the course and/or on project
teams.

You can get a kit of your own for cheap, and this is encouraged! This way you
can engage more easily in your own projects and feel more free to do anything
you dream up. Let us know if you want help ordering (you can find us on the
Gitter chat, linked in the footer below).

## Tentative plan

We'll see how far we get, and move what's left to a later class:

 - Interfacing the Arduino with a sensor (using Arduino C)
 - Getting data from an Arduino to a computer with SD cards
 - Bridging to Arduinos with Bluetooth and serial
 - Establishing and maintaining reliable connections
 - Micro-databases and communications protocols
 - Networking peripherals
 - Basic data management
 - Advanced sensors
