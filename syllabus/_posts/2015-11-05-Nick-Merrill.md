## Background information

Nick Merrill will talk about what’s possible with biosensors. How much of
someone’s thoughts might you read with an EEG? How much of someone’s emotional
state could be read with sensors? The answers to these questions, and more,
will not be definitively answered in this seminar!

## Agenda

- *12:10* Dav will give a brief overview of [the work he's been doing with SHO
  Zemi on understanding kids in the context of
  tutoring](http://hackingmeasurement.berkeley.edu/projects/primary-ed-tutoring.html).
  ([slides](/syllabus/presenter-materials/natsuzemi-android.pptx))
- *12:40* Nick will take over and give us a presentation on biosensing!
- Then... we'll have time for discussion.

#AGENDA
Dav on tutoring/asessing "Natsu Zemi"
Nick Merrill on Biosensing
Open discussion/planning - Peer asessment starts next week!

#Natsu Zemi
- Why Dav went to Japan to study
Education is hard
We still haven't figured out how to teach reading (whole word vs phonics)
Scientific evidence is not enough to shift social-cultural systems
What if scientist-teachers could see results themselves?
Working with Sho Zemi
Sho Zemi has ~26,000 students across 200 sites, MOOC-like scale with physical access
Emotional assessment using VAS
Cognitive assessments with Lumosity
Using sliding scales are categorically better than bucket categories while conducting surveys
To help students identify what is going on with their learners
Rich data set which could lead to interesting insights
Dav wants to be able to predict changes in test scores of students
Quantitative ethnography approach
Large variance in students' reaction times

#Biosensing
What are you trying to sense?
What's the phenomenon? Where does it "exist"?
Can sensors actually detect it?
Affdex uses your face to understand your emotion
Apple watch uses heart rate sensor. What can it measure?
Physical activity
Excitement
Chronic disease history
Apple watch used sharing heart beats as a way to be intimate/share intimacy
What are the affordances of heart rate as compared to something else, say, EEG?
Suggestability of a sensor and their consequences
Social signalling
Sensors and their data exsit in a rich social space.
When we accept to give our data via biosensors, what are we consenting to?
Actually measuring data
512 samples/second from EEG device
60 people
