  code is in our Gitter chat), and have a look around.
- Read a draft of either
  - [Dawn's intro to an upcoming Quantified Self
    text](/syllabus/presenter-materials/Nafus Introduction to Quanified.pdf)
  - (much lighter) [Data Data
    Everywhre](https://www.epicpeople.org/data-data-everywhere/) article.

## Tentative plan

We'll continue our anthropological and technical interrogation of human-related
quantification (including things like biosensors and air quality).

This session will be held **during the Tuesday 3:30 practicum in BIDS**. Come
prepared to hack, as we will transition to a mix of guided and self-directed
work after what should be a lively discussion! Interested folks can explore the
use of the Data Sense platforms for their own data / projects.
