## Background information

Please review the list of projects on the [potential projects
page](/projects.html)! (It's also linked in the menu of *every* page on this
site).

## Tentative plan

Starting at 3:30, we'll have project overviews. Dav and Anthony will provide a
description of most, but a few guest clients will talk a little more in depth
about their projects. *In particular, Jorrit will provide a brief technical
introduction to data management for published research data.*

We'll form teams, including creating repos and chat rooms where needed. To give
you an idea of how we'll get started, please see where Jorrit has started
putting additional information in [the EDAM
repo](https://github.com/BIDS-collaborative/EDAM) and I've added some info on
my leg-work for testing air quality sensors in [an
issue](https://github.com/BIDS-collaborative/air-quality/issues/2).

Javier will also be on hand to help folks who want to review anything from the
previous seminar on Arduino, including discussing any future hardware plans you
may be forming.

Dav will plan to keep the space open until about 6pm.
