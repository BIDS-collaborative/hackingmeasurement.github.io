## Background information

Please review the list of projects on the [potential projects
page](/projects.html)! (It's also linked in the menu of *every* page on this
site).

## Tentative plan

This will be a final meeting to review projects with client presentations.
Projects include opportunities to learn about sensors (IoT), scraping, and
mobile technology (with phones and tablets). **Presentations will start at 3:30
followed by meeting with clients and team formation.** Dav and Anthony will
provide a description of most, but a few guest clients will talk a little more
in depth about their projects. *In particular, Jorrit will provide a brief
technical introduction to data management for published research data.*

We'll create [repos](https://github.com/BIDS-collaborative) and [chat
rooms](https://gitter.im/orgs/BIDS-collaborative/rooms) where needed. To give
you an idea of how we'll get started, please see where Jorrit has started
putting additional information in [the EDAM
repo](https://github.com/BIDS-collaborative/EDAM) and I've added some info on
my leg-work for testing air quality sensors in [an
issue](https://github.com/BIDS-collaborative/air-quality/issues/2).

It is also critical that each team have a lead who will be responsible for
communicating with the class facilitators (like me).

Javier and others will also be on hand to help folks who want to review
anything from the previous seminar on Arduino, including discussing any future
hardware plans you may be forming.

Dav will plan to keep the space open until about 6pm.
