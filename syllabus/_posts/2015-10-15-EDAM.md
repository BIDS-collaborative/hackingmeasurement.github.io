## Background information

The EDAM team is developing a tool to analyse and compare biodiversity on 
islands. Biodiversity completion can then be used to promote collaboration
among researchers.

The Carpool project is collecting data via the moves app and working towards
detection of possible carpools.

Dav will lead us through a survey on Kobo, and explain some of the features
that might be relevant in different survey contexts. If there's time, he'll
also talk about a recent survey project he did.

## EDAM

### Problems

- Identify factors that define biodiversity completeness
- Estimate 100% completeness
- Acquire data (open and locked)
- Promote research collaboration and open data

### Tentative plan

- Discuss project proposal
- Island biogeography
- Initial plan of approach
