## Background information

The EDAM team is developing a tool to analyse and compare biodiversity on 
islands. Biodiversity completion can then be used to promote collaboration
among researchers.

The Carpool project is collecting data via the moves app and working towards
detection of possible carpools.

Dav will lead us through a survey on Kobo, and explain some of the features
that might be relevant in different survey contexts. If there's time, he'll
also talk about a recent survey project he did.

## Announcements / Check-ins

- [Nerds for Nature
  summit](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/nerds-for-nature-summit-tickets-18110605308)
  this weekend!
- What's going on with data loggers? Have you logged data? Where is it?
- Can *everyone else* do a check in next week?

## EDAM

### Problems

- Identify factors that define biodiversity completeness
- Estimate 100% completeness
- Acquire data (open and locked)
- Promote research collaboration and open data

### Tentative plan

- Discuss project proposal
- Island biogeography
- Initial plan of approach

## Carpool Project

- Collecting data (our greatest challenge)
- Anonymizing, objectifying, and parsing data (to address this challenge)
- Creating data objects, links and constraints (for analysis and conclusions)
- Visualizing results (using templates)

## Surveys

- A review of approaches to surveys
- Collective look at Dav's Kobo survey
- Let's design our own!

## If there's time

- Neat Stuff Dav has done with a Japanese tutoring company
