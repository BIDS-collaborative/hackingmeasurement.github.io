## Background information

The EDAM team is developing a tool to analyse and compare biodiversity on 
islands. Biodiversity completion can then be used to promote collaboration
among researchers. 

## Reading / Tech

- [GloBI search interface](http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/)
- [Island biogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_biogeography)
- [Data completeness article](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150907/ncomms9221/full/ncomms9221.html)

## Problems

- Identify factors that define biodiversity completeness
- Estimate 100% completeness
- Acquire data (open and locked)
- Promote research collaboration and open data

## Tentative plan

- Discuss project proposal
- Island biogeography
- Initial plan of approach
