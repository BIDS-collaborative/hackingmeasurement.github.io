## Welcome to Hacking Measurement

We'll get oriented and be introduced to the technology for organizing the class
and the BIDS collaborative.

## Reading / Tech

Please have a quick look at the [Jekyll Docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
We'll also use either Slack or Gitter to communicate about things – I haven't decided
yet. If you'd like to have a say, read up on them ahead of time!

## Tentative plan

 - Introducing the class – who's in the room?
 - The short history of the BIDS Collaborative
 - About the class website, and expectations for contributing
 - Looking ahead to basic sensor hacking (Javier Rosa)
