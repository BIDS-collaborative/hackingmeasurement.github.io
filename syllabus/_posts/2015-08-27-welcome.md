## Welcome to Hacking Measurement

We'll get oriented and be introduced to the technology for organizing the class
and the BIDS collaborative.

## Reading / Tech

Please have a quick look at the [Jekyll Docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
We'll also use either Slack or Gitter to communicate about things – I haven't decided
yet. If you'd like to have a say, read up on them ahead of time!

## Tentative plan

 - Introducing the class – who's in the room?
 - The short history of the BIDS Collaborative
 - Development Engineering: the potential impact of sensors, mobile, and
   satellite data
 - About the class website, and expectations for contributing
    - Introducing the project orientation
    - How to contribute to the website with Jekyll (it's part of the grade!)
 - Looking ahead to basic sensor hacking (Javier Rosa)

### People's Areas of Interest

- Education
- Entrepreneur
- Economic Development
- Environment
- Wellness

### Temina Madon

- Works with [CEGA](http://cega.berkeley.edu/).
- Data analytics in development. Looking for projects and students to pair.
- Starting 'pseudo-discipline' of development engineering.
- Starting a new journal (*Development Engineering* with Elsevier): design, measurement, *etc.*
- One goal: learn from development programs' failures (*e.g.* [PlayPump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout_PlayPump)).
- Up to now: utilize popular development methodology of randomized control trials (RCTs)—experiments in development economics.
- New goal: "revolutionize measurement." Current methods are costly, can be inaccurate (recording error, self-reporting errors, general bias), are infrequent, *etc.*
- Projects of interest:
    - **The Goldilocks Project**
        - Estimating agricultural yields
        - Identify farmers' plots using satellite data (high-resolution needed for half-hectare plots)
        - David Lobell and Marshall Burke
        - Use data from [Skybox](http://www.skyboximaging.com)
    - **Sensors**
        - Do people use cookstoves?
        - Response and cognitive biases appear to be pretty high here: 
            - 99% of respondents claim to use these cookstoves 3 times/day, every day.
            - Sensing data suggest considerably lower levels of use (approximately half of reported levels).
        - Other applications: filters, latrines, and power.
        - Governments (might) want to know: does investment in technology yield results?
    - **Smartphones**
        - [Premise Data](https://www.premise.com)
        - Push tasks to agents (*e.g.* pay agents for images of households within 1km).
        - Reliability of the process? Not technically crowdsourcing.    
    - **Passive Measurement**
        - GridWatch
        - Crowdsourcing

### BIDS

- [BIDS](http://bids.berkeley.edu)'s Major goal: amplify on-campus collaboration at Berkeley.
- Past projects:
    - Visualization projects using energy data (D3)
    - Supply chain management
    - Market analytics for underwear startup
    - DeStress: cognitive science
    - High-frequency trading
- Currently building a set of courses: (Hacking Measurement, Diversity, ...)

### General Course Stuff

- Course website:
    - Taking notes using [etherpad](http://www.etherpad.mozilla.org)
    - We'll follow the [course website](http://hackingmeasurement.berkeley.edu/syllabus/) pretty closely. See the schedule.
    - The syllabus is a work in progress.
    - The course website uses Pages with GitHub. [Here is the repo.](https://github.com/hackingmeasurement/hackingmeasurement.github.io)
    - To update the notes on GitHub: go to the lecture in ".../syllabus/_posts/" an update (using [MarkDown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)).
- Reason for the waitlist: force everyone to build/join teams early. Teams then get registration codes. And teams need leads.
- People are welcome to introduce their own projects. 
- Dave will distribute a list of projects soon.
- The next few weeks:
    - Take a shallow-to-medium dive into the tools.
    - Start with sensors (Arduinos, ...).
    - Satellite imagery.
    - Utility data.
    - Use familiar software/languages. Projects will generally determine the tools.
    - **Next Tuesday: crash course for GitHub.** (190 Doe Library)

### To Do:

- Can we get slides from Temina? Person 2 for today's note-taking can follow up.
- Dav needs GitHub ids from each person. Leave your id (and possibly name) on the course's repository.
- **Optional:** Buy some Arduino stuff. Dav can help put together a nice shopping cart.
