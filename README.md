This is the [GitHub Pages]() site for <http://hackingmeasurement.berkeley.edu>.
You should read about [GitHub Pages](), but if you're in a hurry, you can just click on a file,
followed by clicking the little pencil icon to edit a page. All of the pages are in `_posts`.

To view the site locally for development, you should run `jekyll serve` from the same directory
as this README.md file.

A few non-obvious details:

 - You can include a bunch of named links via `{% include orgs.md %}` anywhere
   in a (markdown) document.
 - You can enable Disqus comments in a page with `comments: true` in the YAML
   header. Comments are currently enabled for meetings, and disabled for regular
   posts (but that should probably be changed as well).
