## Overview

We propose workshop or series of workshops that will bring
together researchers in the behavioral sciences who are currently employing
mobile data collection methodologies with colleagues who could benefit from or
are curious about deploying the same technologies and techniques in their own
studies.

## Purpose

The goal of this forum is to galvanize resources towards the
creation of an open technological and educational infrastructure that will
support mobile social science research at Berkeley. This will reduce duplicated
efforts and minimize the cost and technical debt associated with implementation
of bespoke systems.

More concretely, we hope that these meetings will catalyze developer and
researcher interest in collaborating on a unified platform to rapidly prototype
and test mobile behavioral research techniques in the field during Summer 2014.

## Tasks

* Schedule a time (Reading Week suggested) 
* Reserve a place
* Identify and coordinate speakers
* Invites, agenda, and associated ephemera

## Ideas, etc.

* Any other sections that are necessary or desired, please add! A general topic
  list would be useful.

## Topics

### Open Source Toolkits.

Sid Feygin to present on XMobile and open source toolkits/potential
collaborative efforts.

### Design

Pablo (and others - perhaps someone from a clinical perspective?)

### Data Mining and Backend Needs

* [pablo.paredes@berkeley.edu](/ep/profile/GtvziSKq8oh) mentioned this. Maybe
  ask John Canny to present? 
* Also should invite someone from AMP? I still think this should be minimized
  in the initial workshop(s)

We would like to present on the potential for data mining to improve the
relationship between providers and individuals as well as provide a novel
modality for insight for the behavioral heath care research community as a
whole.

## Security

The relationship between patient and provider is built on trust. How will the
software platform maintain subject anonymity as well as provide an interesting
opportunity for exploration of the design aspects of this development space?

*Daniel Aranki ended up talking about his approach.*

## Folks to invite

* Aaron Fisher, Ann Kring, & Clinicians
* Full Behav. Meas. & Change group (broadly construed)
* BCRN / IPSR (talk to Bob Barde? Def. Elizabeth Peele)
* Maybe have a sister event in D-Lab that is less psych focused, more "other"
  social science (and humanities?)
* Serge Egelman on security
