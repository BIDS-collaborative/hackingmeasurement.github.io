## Course Description

This course is being offered as a part of the [Data Science Collaborative][DSC]
at the [Berkeley Institute of Data Science (BIDS)][BIDS]. We will take a
project-based approach to social and environmental measurement incorporating
mobile devices, "Internet of Things" (or "Web of Things") style sensors, and
remote sensing. There will be a classroom discussion each week, followed by a
tutorial / practicum in BIDS. We will leverage support from the [Social Science
Matrix][Matrix], the [D-Lab][Dlab], [BIDS][BIDS], and [Berkeley Research
Computing][BRC] to provide necessary training, hardware, and compute resources.
Note that the focus of this course is on data collection and management. Teams
will likely do some basic visualization and exploratory data analysis --
statistics and/or machine learning are not expected.

Students will work with project clients, who will help determine the project
roadmap. Note that the primary goal of the course is educational -- solving the
client challenges is a vehicle for learning. Credit will only be available to
individuals who are selected for project teams (ideal teams will include a
balance of individuals with project management, technical, and domain-specific
skills). The course will be open to drop-in attendance for all members of the
campus community.

Students should either know how to do basic scientific computing or be prepared
to learn outside of class (potentially with help from your classmates). In
addition, each week will only provide an *orientation* to the necessary skills
-- we can't provide an in-depth introduction to all of these topics in one
semester! Students will likely need to do additional learning to develop
meaningful skills.  Available resources on campus (e.g., in [D-Lab][Dlab] and
[BIDS][BIDS]) will be advertised to course participants.

## Tentative Curriculum

Please note, the curriculum is very much a work in progress.

 - Week 1
    - Lecture: Overview of issues in social and environmental measurement
    - Selection of team leads for projects
    - Practical: project management with GitHub, part 1
 - Week 2
    - Lecture: An introduction to ethical and legal concerns
    - Final selection of teams, codes available for telebears
    - Practical: Creation of team repositories, wiki, and project roadmap in
      issue tracker. Identification of needed technical resources, including
      budget.
 - Weeks 3-6 and 9-11 (order determined by plans from week 2 and speaker
   availability)
    - Intro to Jekyll / GitHub pages.
    - Basic data management (ODK Aggregate, Data Turbine, Postgres, MongoDB,
      ASbase)
    - Basic visualization (High-level d3, pointers to R and Python on your own)
    - Mobile devices (ODK, Data Turbine)
    - IoT/WoT sensors (Arduino + Bluetooth LE)
    - Remote sensing and geospatial data (Ecoengine, mapbox/leaflet, Google
      earth engine)
    - Administrative and utility data (Satellite imagery, Call record data,
      Electricity & Water)

 - Mid-semester (2 weeks)
    - Presentations: discuss successes, plans, and difficulties. Mid-semester
      presentations have a "technical" focus, with a goal of enabling your
      classmates.
    - Practical: teams and mentors work together to ensure successes are
      reproducible, pull in outside skills to address challenges. Videos of
      presentations reviewed by presenters and viewers.
 - Final presentations (2 weeks)
   - Discuss results in a non-technical fashion.
   - Practical: Finalize reproducible and transparent research reports (test
     reproducibility via other teams attempts to reproduce).

## Grading

Percentage breakdown TBD.

 - Clarity / reproducibility of methods and results (presented on GitHub,
   assessed twice at mid-semester and final, strongly weighted towards final).
 - Quality of presentations (incorporating self assessment and peer assessment)
 - Quality of self assessment
 - Quality of peer assessment

Open questions:

 - Should all team-members get the same grade for team project? Or should teams
   be allowed to assign credit to different members?
 - How do students get credit for helping other teams?
