So, now you have a project and want to continue working? Here are some ideas
for support.

## BIDS and the D-Lab

Feel free to keep in touch with Dav, and he'll help you navigate working with
[BIDS][BIDS] and the [D-Lab][DLab].

## URAP

The [URAP](http://research.berkeley.edu/urap/) program is a great way to get
undergrads working with you on a project with clearly defined goals. That said,
please don't think of undergrads as "slave labor" - the best results will come
from respectful relationships with a clear learning objective for all
participants!

## Makerspaces

You don't need to do everything on a college campus. Following is a partial
list of maker spaces you might check out:

- ManyLabs: *the* maker space for science. Dav is a resident and can tell you
  more.
- NoiseBridge
- Langton Labs
- Ace Monster Toys
- NIMBY
- American Steel
- The Crucible
- Counterculture Labs
- Mothership HackerMoms

Dav also knows random grungy groups of people focused on hacking tiny housing
and human waste / environmental issues. They don't necessarily have
public-facing websites, though.

Likewise, you might find folks by posting general calls on Facebook or Twitter!

## Support

Hacking Measurement was an initiative of the BIDS Collaborative. We drew on
support from the Siemens Web of Things group, BIDS, the Social Science Matrix,
the I School, the D-Lab, CEGA, DIL, and others. *These are all great resources
going forwards also!*
