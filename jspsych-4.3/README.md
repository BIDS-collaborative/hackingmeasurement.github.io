jsPsych is a JavaScript library for creating and running behavioral experiments in a web browser. jsPsych simplifies the process of coding browser-based experiments by providing a set of flexibile plugins that define different kinds of tasks a subject could complete during an experiment. By assembling different plugins together and customizing the parameters of each, it is possible to create many different types of experiments.
