## About NeurotechX

NeurotechX is an international group of scientists, makers, hackers, interested in collaboration and exploration of neuro-related technologies.

## Project Details

The project my group and I have been working on for over a year involves the
process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing sensor data. It is a complete
platform and is first and foremost a platform for EEG acquisition, analysis,
and display. However, we have had some people show interest in connecting this
software to other devices. As of now, our stack includes Python (flask),
RabbitMQ, Cassandra, and Angularjs. It is an open source project that can be
found [here](https://github.com/marionleborgne/cloudbrain).

We are trying to allow for people to have a working platform for biosensor data
that is free and open source. The neuroscience community could benefit from
having a large repository of EEG signals and other bio information. This also
provides a platform for other experiments (like group EEG readings,
Event-related potentials, remote-analysis medical infrastructure, etc.)
