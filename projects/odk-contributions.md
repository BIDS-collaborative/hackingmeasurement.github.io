## About ODK

The [Open Development Kit (ODK)](opendatakit.org) is a leading system for data
collection on the Android platform.

## Project Description

Sid has implemented an "android intent" that allows the use of "Visual Analog
Scales" on ODK. These are nice, as you can read about on Wikipedia.

It is the Right Thing To Do to submit Sid's ODK mods upstream. This will be
very technical, involving cleaning up existing modifications to the ODK
platform (so, Java development for Android). Also, consideration of the XForms
standard. On the flipside, it's actually done. So, it's mostly code review and
cleanup.
