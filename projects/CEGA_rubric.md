## Real-world challenge

This project aims at quantifying the impact of CEGA's research on policy making. The challenge is that tracking citations of published research does not provide an adequate measure of the influence, and thus, one has to search the gray literature to identify the impact of the research on policy making. The gain from this project is to determine the returns on investment in international development research which could ultimately be used as an proof of concept to get funding for social science research. Everyone would benefit from tracing the influence of funding on solving social issues, being able to wisely allocate their resources, the scientists would be more efficient at tacking problems. The developing communities would benefit and the governments and organizations that fund the research could spend the same amount of funding more wisely.  

## Data / Materials

CEGA team memebers have focused on the World Bank policy repository, research published on conditional cash transfer(CCT) evaluation, number of citation on policy reports, academic research data basis and Aid data. The team used both txt files on Open Knowledge and also they used meta data to crawl the xml feed for getting the right publication

## Approach

CEGA team mostly uses R for text mining and some python libraries and MySQL. They seem to need to use some tools for statistical analysis, R and excel could be used to achieve this goal. 

## Project Management

CEGA team had set goals for themselves by the week. They hoped to mine data from the World Bank, analyse it and present their findings regarding the "Path of Influence". They likely have faced the same initial challenge of getting everyone on the same page and up to speed on the goal of the project. The team is currently working on building/finalizing three databses for research papers, policy reports and cited research paper, and the world bank's annual development reports. The ultimate goal for the team is to build a visual tool to map the influence of the research on policy making.
