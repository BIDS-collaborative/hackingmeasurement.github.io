## Project description

Aurorasaurus is a website and phone app that allows anyone to submit data to a
database -- through a simple form -- describing an Aurora they are seeing. NASA
uses these data to cross-validate their models from satellites. Liz MacDonald
(NASA project lead) -- upon hearing about Nick's work -- has asked Nick to
repurpose the code for protest observation.

The project will consist of converting an open source platform for
crowdsourcing observations of auroras to the domain of protest observation
