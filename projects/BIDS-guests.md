## About BIDS

The Berkeley Institute for Data Science is a central hub of research and
education at UC Berkeley designed to facilitate and nurture data-intensive
science. We'll be hosting our BIDS Collaborative sessions in the Doe Library
space!

## Project description

We'll integrate more advanced sensors and hardware for keeping track of entrance into
the BIDS space. This will include *not* tracking folks who don't want to be
tracked. A basic JSON API back-end and a ReactJS powered front-end have already
been developed. Similarly, Dani Ushizima has already developed a machine vision
system to scan arbitrary ID cards.

We'll begin by connecting these pre-existing technologies. If time permits, we
may persue other forms of tracking, including the exploration of more whimsical
ideas at ManyLabs.

We will also seek to incorporate existing approaches used by other campus
groups, including the Library's Data Lab, and the Citris Innovations Labs.
