## Background

J.B. works at the Brain Imaging Center. This is an on campus facility which
collects brain imaging data such as anatomical and functional MRI.

## Description

The project is to help data mining a web resource that collects information
from brain imaging publication : http://brainspell.org/.

This site allows to enter keywords of cognitive/sensory domains such as
"vision", "memory", etc, and extract the x,y,z coordinates that have been
reported in publications in these domains. A map of the brain is constructed in
the browser showing where these coordinates are across the publications.

This is potentially a very useful resource for having an overview of the
regions of the brain reported in papers.

We would like to extend the tool to answer a number of question of interest
linked to effect sizes and power analyses (see project objectives).

## Project Objectives

Here are some examples of questions we would like to answer with brainspell:

 * Are the regions found with different number of subject in studies ?
 * What does the map of effect size map of effect size per cognitive domain
   look like ?
 * How to use Map of effect size for a cognitive domain to do reverse inference
   (ie find what are the cognitive domains most likely associated with a brain
   region) ;
 * Combine map of number of subjects and map of effect size to get map of power
   (per cognitive domain)
