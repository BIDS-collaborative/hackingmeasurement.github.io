## About Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine

An open API serving UC Berkeley's Natural History Data

## Project description

Please visit the interactive, user-friendly portal here:  https://holos.berkeley.edu/

The "Ecoengine" is an informatics tool that has:

*Event Data*: Organize, unify, and serve a wealth of "event" data from UC
Berkeleyâ€™s labs, natural history museums, and field stations. *Baselayer Data*:
Organize, unify, and serve an array of baselayers relevant to ecological
analysis including climate, land cover/use, vegetation indices, hydrology,
fire, and other freely available datasets.  *Interface*: Provides a platform
for visualization, analysis, and sharing of the disparate and complex data that
are critical to understanding global change biology.

For API and related documentation, please visit:  http://ecoengine.berkeley.edu/

The Ecoengine allows for unprecedented integration of data and expertise
necessary to address the challenge of identifying the interactions and
feedbacks between different species and their environment. Key features of the
Ecoengine include easy and rapid access to vast amounts of disparate data, the
ability to perform rapid exploratory analyses and tests for correlations, and
the ability to visualize and communicate results to a broad community of users.
It promotes the type of multi-disciplinary building that will lead to
breakthroughs in our understanding of the biotic input and response to global
change. The Ecoengine serves to unite previously disconnected perspectives from
paleo-ecologists, population biologists, and ecologists and make possible the
testing of predictive models of global change, a critical advance in making the
science more rigorous.

## Potential project

Build a "collector tracker" / competition dashboard.

This map driven dashboard that allows a user to navigate the specimen
collections of any particular scientist, by name.

 - Visualize all collecting events on the map
 - chart what kind of species were collected by any one person
 - Who collected to most by number, most by diversity, etc.
 - Who covered the most area
