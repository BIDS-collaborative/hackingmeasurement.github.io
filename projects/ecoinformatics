## About Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine

An open API serving UC Berkeley's Natural History Data

## Project description

Please visit the interactive, user-friendly portal here:  https://holos.berkeley.edu/

The "Ecoengine" is an informatics tool that has:

Event Data: Organize, unify, and serve a wealth of "event" data from UC Berkeleyâ€™s labs, natural history museums, and field stations.
Baselayer Data: Organize, unify, and serve an array of baselayers relevant to ecological analysis including climate, land cover/use, vegetation indices, hydrology, fire, and other freely available datasets.
Interface: Provides a platform for visualization, analysis, and sharing of the disparate and complex data that are critical to understanding global change biology.
 
For API and related documentation, please visit:  http://ecoengine.berkeley.edu/  

The Ecoengine allows for unprecedented integration of data and expertise necessary to address the challenge of identifying the interactions and feedbacks between different species and their environment. Key features of the Ecoengine include easy and rapid access to vast amounts of disparate data, the ability to perform rapid exploratory analyses and tests for correlations, and the ability to visualize and communicate results to a broad community of users. It promotes the type of multi-disciplinary building that will lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of the biotic input and response to global change. The Ecoengine serves to unite previously disconnected perspectives from paleo-ecologists, population biologists, and ecologists and make possible the testing of predictive models of global change, a critical advance in making the science more rigorous.
