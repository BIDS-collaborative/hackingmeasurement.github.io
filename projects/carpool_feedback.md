# Real-world challenge

This project aims at making carpooling as common as driving. The project hinges on the (testable) hypothesis that we there are enough trips independently made through similar routes at similar times.
If successfully implemented, this project can potentially contribute the solutions of pressing world problem such as traffic congestion and climate change as well as help the drivers recover a portion of their transportation costs while offering passengers a viable transportation alternative. 


# Data - Materials - Approach

The project will initially depend on data collection on common routes to cafefully quantify the commonalities in eveyday commuting patterns of potential users. The plan is to tap into the data that is collected from a mobile app called "Moves". This app records the locations that the users go to and the time. THe users are then will be asked to download the data into their computers on a daily basis and will get paid to share their data. 


# Overall Feedback

I think this is a wonderful idea that can have a significant impact on some real world problems. I would like to share my opinons on some of the issues that I see with the implementation.

## Brochure
First of all I had a chance to take a look at the brochure with which the users will be recruited. It seems to be filled with clear information on what the project is and how they can contribute. 
But the visual design of the brochure could be made more appealing with colors that are easier on the eye. The second page is too crowded. I think you only have 10 seconds to capture the attention of a person who picks up this brochure at BART. I think it can be made a lot more intriguing and enticing. Communicaton is very important. 

## Data collection
I am not quite sold on the idea that the users will upload their data. Life is short and people are busy. You would have to pay me a lot of money to get me to upload my info. I'd rather read my favoritte book.
But if it were done by and app that automatically talks to Move without bothering me I'd do it.

## Compare and contrast with other similar solutions
I think somewhere in the pitch it should say why this is a better solution that say Uber and Lyft.
