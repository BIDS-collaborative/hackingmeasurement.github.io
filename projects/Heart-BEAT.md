## Background

Electrocardiography is the process of recording the electrical activity of 
the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on a patient's body. 
These electrodes detect the tiny electrical changes on the skin that arise 
from the heart muscle depolarizing during each heartbeat. The technology is
relatively simple and extremely useful, but it is unfortunately not available
to all. However, everyone owns a smartphone nowadays, even in remote locations
and in the developing world. 

## Project Description

The goal of our project is to develop a 3-lead, afforable, portable and iphone
bluetooth-connected EKG system using arduino technology. Our goals are to:

      1. Be able to collect live data from the electrodes to the iphone
      2. Show the data in real-time as a graph
      3. Collect and analyze the data during effort and movement for extended 
      periods of time
      4. Provide real-time feedback and analysis to the user
