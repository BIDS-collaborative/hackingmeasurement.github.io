## About ManyLabs

Manylabs supports the development of open tools for science and science
education.

## Project Description

Create a public data set comparing a variety of different air quality sensors.
Obtain multiple copies of a range of different air quality sensors (e.g. for
particulates), place them outside (e.g. on the Manylabs roof or at an EPA
station), and have them feed data to a server.

The data and techniques provided by this project would be beneficial for anyone
designing an air quality measurement system. It would also serve as an example
of what would ideally be a general trend toward releasing more sample data for
DIY sensor projects.
