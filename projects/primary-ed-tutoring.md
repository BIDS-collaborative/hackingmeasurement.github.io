## Description

Develop measurement and data management approaches for educational
interventions. A particular focus will be on assisting Prof. Rachel Slaybaugh
with a project where UC Berkeley undergrads tutor second grade students in
underserved schools on Oakland ([DeCal course
website](http://www.decal.org/courses/3734)). Additional topics may include
improving UC Berkeley's (and others') handling of EdX data, and working with a
Japanese tutoring company (SHO Zemi) with over 20,000 students. We will engage
in design processes over the course of the semester, including assessment of
available technologies (e.g., making use of whatever phones, etc. kids happen
to have). Technology will likely include mobile approaches to experience
sampling, adaptive / automated testing over the web, and perhaps sensor- or
video-based affective measurement.
