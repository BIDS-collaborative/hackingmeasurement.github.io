Tech4Measurement is a [Social Science Matrix][Matrix] supported research seminar
that seeks to improve the usage of sensor, mobile, and remote-sensing technology
to measure social phenomena. The Data Science Collaborative at BIDS is applying
lessons learned from our first semester facilitating graduate student teams
working on client projects, providing a rare opportunity for real-world,
hands-on learning.
