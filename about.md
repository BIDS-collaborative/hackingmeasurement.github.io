Tech4Measurement is a [Social Science Matrix][Matrix] supported research seminar
that seeks to improve the usage of sensor, mobile, and remote-sensing technology
to measure social phenomena. The Data Science Collaborative at BIDS is applying
lessons learned from our first semester facilitating graduate student teams
working on client projects, providing a rare opportunity for real-world,
hands-on learning.

## Support

Tech4Measurement is an initiative of the Data Science Collaborative at BIDS and
Glass Bead Labs. We draw on support from the Siemens Web of Things group, BIDS,
the Social Science Matrix, the I School, the D-Lab, CEGA, DIL, and others. (A
nicer page with logos coming soon!)
